# ElixirTicTacToe

This is a TicTacToe CLI game made in Elixir for learning purposes.  Everything is in one module.  Thought about splitting stuff like rendering and end-game logic in to their own modules, and may do so in the future.  

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `elixir_tic_tac_toe` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_tic_tac_toe, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
